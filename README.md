The goal of the **[Okapi Framework](https://code.google.com/p/okapi/)** is to allow tools developers and localizers to build new localization processes or enhance existing ones to best meet their needs, while preserving a level of compatibility and interoperability. It also provides them with a way to share (and re-use) components across different solutions.

**Okapi Acorn** is project to experiment various localization-related technologies.

  * Part of the Acorn project is a tentative / prototyping **object model for XLIFF**. You can see the documentation for it here: **http://opentag.com/data/xliffomapi/**. And the discussion list for this topic is here: https://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/xliff-users/.

  * Another part of the Acorn project is a simple implementation of the **TAUS Translation API v2**. See https://labs.taus.net/interoperability/taus-translation-api for more details.
